# Currency Conversion App 


Write a small JavaScript currency conversion application using React.  The user should be able to select a source country currency, a destination country currency, and the amount to convert. 

You will need to use the following APIs to complete this task: 

·         https://restcountries.eu/ to retrieve a list of countries. 

·         https://www.exchangerate-api.com/ to retrieve exchange rates (sign up required). 

Some important things to consider are: 

·         Error handling 

·         Performance 

·         Handling sensitive config like API Keys 

·         UI/UX
